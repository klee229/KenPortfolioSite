								<h2>Ping Application Elevator Pitch</h2>
									<p>Did you know that the last few years we saw a turnover rate of around 42% across several industries? What could be done about this? Well, many medium-size companies are trying to do two things: build company culture and encourage good communication. 
										They might be using platforms like Slack, but something is not working. Employees in the company do not feel like they can communicate openly, do not feel valued, and do not feel a clear sense of how they fit into the bigger picture. That is where we can help. We are a team of five college undergraduates with degrees in the area 
										of Computer Science and Engineering and a passion for leveraging software to help make life easier. We aim to create a platform that tackles these issues of how to create company culture, retain employees, and rethink communication. To do this in both an online and in-person environment, we need to be more than just a chat app. 
										We will aggregate your existing communication platforms into one place. We will analyze how employees communicate individually and offer suggestions on how to remain professional in their interactions. We will consider the urgency of each message and advise when it is best to send them, reducing the noise and allowing people to work continuously without distraction.
										 We will allow for channels of anonymous, and safely encrypted, communication. We will encourage team-building and peer-to-peer interactions with polls, surveys, wellbeing resources, and information boards that are all open to feedback. In other words, we are here to do the heavy lifting and address problems at the source, so companies do not have to.</p>
